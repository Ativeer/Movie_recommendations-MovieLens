# Movie-recommendations-MovieLens

The objective is to recommend movies to users at two levels: 
	- First, based on their past rating history 
	- Second, based on impromptu genre-movie selections. 
The first prediction model would take into consideration the rating history of all customers, 
and having understood the watching patterns of similar users, recommend the user a movie 
he/she may be interested in. 
The second model would take genre as input and 3 movies he/she likes in that genre, thereafter 
recommend movies like the movies in the selected genre.
